# Interactive approach to telling your data story with Shiny. 



It interacts with our data and our analysis and does it all with R.
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. 
We can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. 
We can also extend our Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
